Things to do for next class:

1. Let's focus on finishing our Research Proposal- I have already shared
a Google Doc with you so check your Drive if you haven't already.

2. For our idea, I think that we should go ahead with your idea of just being able to
put an image from your phone onto the wall. I think the next step would be putting up
video, and then after that implementing graffiti. Tell me what you think.
