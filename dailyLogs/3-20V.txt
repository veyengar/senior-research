Bad News Log

Yo Richie, Koseku sensei has determined that we need to make a new project and slowly bring in the stuff that
worked in the past and build off of that. You should start with the augmented reality example activity. Maybe 
start by removing the template stuff we dont need. Then bring in the basic stuff that we had before. Good luck,
I will continue on wednesday and friday.
