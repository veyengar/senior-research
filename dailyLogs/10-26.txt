FINALLY fixed Git problems. My past logs are on there if you want to read the past xD.
I'm sorry, I'll make sure my logs are in here from now on.


Today:

Discussion was good. Immalla didn't say anything tho so I guess it wasn't great. Kosek 
enjoyed it. He is still hyped about our project. xD. Dreading today. CommonApp essay due,
Math test tmrw. Art proj due tomorrow.

The progress check is due next Tues/Wed! Gl hf

Started using the pen tablet. Fun fun fun.

Drawing layouts for the app. We shd rlly start coding soon.

Also, that computer works fine. idk what you are talking about.

I had Mr. Kosek check on it, he might talk to you tomorrow. Be less of an awkward teenager.

Main layout idea first draft:  https://wireframe.cc/3mJo7w
	if you hover over the orange dots you can see notes I added. 

you shd probs be able to click view to see w/fullscreen so thatd b another layout bit its
just a full screen thing.

For the splash screen we can make a nice logo or something and have it show that with a small
loading animation.
