yO! I GOT IT IN A PLANE! you might enjoy the picture i put on it ;)
the sizing for this is kind of weird rn, so im working on getting the dimensions of the image to make it less nasty.
the last step for this function would be to have a button that uploads the from the gallery. im pretty sure that the
Tango has already attached the image to a physical location based on where u first hold up the Tango to... so we just
need to find a way to store that or something.

next step is getting that screenshot. couldn't ask mr. kosek today bc he was sicing some other group the entire time ;(
i tried playing around with it and added an @override but i think it doesn't exist in the rajawali renderer :/

just as a fair warning... sometimes the app crashes if it's running too long or if the device gets hot so ki o tsukete.
