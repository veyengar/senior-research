What I did today:
- I really thought that getting a button to take a screenshot would be no big deal, but I can't get it to work :/
In my personal opinion, I think that this function is necessary, but I guess it isn't a priority right now.
I just thought that it wouldn't take this long >.<
	- My code for screenshots is at the very bettom of AugmentedRealityActivity.java
	  I tried 2 different methods, and neither of them worked
	- IMPORTANT: I changed the RajawaliSurfaceView to a RajawaliTextureView **it basically functions the same**
	  just so you are not confused THE NAME OF THE TEXTUREVIEW IS STILL mSurfaceView
	  also, you do NOT need to change it back if you don't want to... should still work the same

For you:
Spend like 30 min or less trying to fix my screenshot stuff :/ If you can't do it either, give up.
After that, try to get a button that will let the user upload an image. SPECIFICALLY, we need a button that can store the file path.
