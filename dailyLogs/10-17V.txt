Two logs in a row! Hope you had fun at hoco and enjoyed your chicken tenders and hamburger.
So I am very tired from this weekend. I slept at like 2:30 last night. Mr. Kosek gave us 
feedback on the paper, I'll add it in here.  We should talk about our project if/when we
meet up on Wednesday. Tilt Tilt Tilt Boom ba boom boom x2. November is fast approaching.
Your time grows short my friend. I'm in the mood to do some drawing today. OH we haven't 
thought of a name yet! For a really basic implementation, we should make lke a little 
TJ mobile lab logo or a small character or something and put it somewhere in the hall next
to the Mobile Lab. That'd b cute. Also, we could use bluetooth beacons to transmit the 
position and photo data if possible. So we could put a beacon outside the mobile lab, have
an image there, and try to put it on the wall. Drawing some designs that say TJ Mobile Lab.
Need to play with Augmented Reality example on the Tango this week to figure out how it 
works. Should probably read some more ACM articles to get a better feel for it.

What I did today:
Talked to Mr. Kosek

Drew pics.

Wrote a bunch of notes/ideas

Did absolutely nothing with the Tango.

Too tired. 

For you:

Hf and try to finish ur proj by Nov 1st.
Play w augmented reality example.

Feedback wise, Mr. Kosek wants us to make sure everything flows and do our references in APA. 
Other than that, he said its good.
