So we figured out that your computer has no network connection. I fixed android studio
on my own computer! It was a lot easier the second time around. 

I downloaded the Augmented Reality application but the tango has NO charge so I'm hoping
it'll be charged next time. I started reading the code to figure out how things work. I
think it'll be easy to make a basic implementation in like two weeks. We don't need unity
Android Studio and the Rajawali framework has enough power to do everything we need.
Check out the Tango augmented_reality_example if you have doubts. I think it'll be really 
cool.


Have a good weekend m8.
