Hey rchrd, too bad we didn't do dress like Arthur day today. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

What I did today:

- Looked at the proposal draft. Most of the parts look good.
  - Added to the research techniques as well as sources. idk how to cite videos in APA/MLA either.

- Which do you want to do? APA or MLA

- Mr. Kosek says research techniques should just be a more technical description of our project. Describing all 
  the like tech stuff. Added some of that. We haven't exactly figured out those details so we need to do that in
  then next few days.

For you:
Read those ACM articles if you want. Try to put some of that stuff into the paper.
Iron out those technical details and write them in. Kosek said this friday is just an outline/rough draft. So its 
important to have all the ideas rather than have a sexy writeup. We can work on the second part next week.

Let me know what tech details you want me to put in. 

Also, see if you can guess who says this quote from Star Wars Rogue One (I may have already mentioned it in Skype 
but lets see if you were paying attention): "I fear nothing. All is, as the Force wills it to be" might not be exact.

I love Cheap Thrills. Also this is fun its like we r pen pals >.<
