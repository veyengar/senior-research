Varun's FeelsBad Log

Dear Richard. I was very unproductive today. RIP. Did some research but didn't amount 
to anything. Tragedy. I'll try harder next week.


I think the whole point of saving the user's choice image to internal storage is so we 
can just pull it up in the other Activity. I'm not sure what is the best way to go about
doing that is. Do whatever you think is best, I'll follow along.


Hope you had a good weekend! I had 3 apps due..lmfao. 1 to go xd
