Worked on the project in the C drive today. Working through this example to get
camera preview working: https://inducesmile.com/android/android-camera2-api-example-tutorial/
Also got some stuff on Unity working but Tango was ded! Plz charge next time ty.

What I did today. 
Got a simple AR app in Unity. Can't run tho cuz Tango has no charge. 
Worked on the app in the C drive, getting camera preview to work. Not done with that

What you should do.
Work on USC if you have to. Otherwise, keep going through the link I sent and add the 
necessary methods to get the camera preview working. You can skip the stuff about 
taking photos (I think) because we wont be taking photos.


Also I want to take a moment to express my utter hatred for your keyboard.
