Richard's Log

it's a new year bb
new year new me(mes)

took a while for me to find exactly where i left off but just as a recap so that you can jump right into the project:
- on the last episode of the "Web/Mobile App Development" anime, Richard-kun had just finished turning the sphere in
the augmented reality project into a plane! he also changed the texture of the plane to a very dashing image of his comrade
Varun <3
- again, last episode's work is under work/tango-examples-java/java_augmented_reality_example
(took me a while to find that)

on this week's episode:
#1 Richard gets started looking at ways for the user to upload their own images from the gallery. He discovered some relevant
links:
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5309190/android-pick-images-from-gallery
	- https://github.com/luminousman/MultipleImagePick

The first link has some more solutions but the second link from github seems very interesting. tbh, we should just use the top
solution from SO but if we have time at the very end, maybe think about incorporating that second link (i doubt we will tho lmao)

UPDATE: started working with some of the solutions in the first link. ran into a "Cannot resolve symbol" error.
under AugmentedRealityActivity.java, look at line 150.

#2 screenshot is still in the works but not really a priority. image upload from user seems like a more pressing issue at this time.

hai hai, this class' episode is over! tune in on thursday to catch more!
