What I did today:
1) Had my seminar; went really really well (y) I could tell that no one read the articles but they still had a lot of
opinions on the topic
2) Giving up on my small project. Let's start the real deal:
	- I edited your interface a tiny bit bc I think the buttons for view/upload should be smaller.

3) ayyyy college apps :^)

For you:
- finish college apps if you need/want to
- I literally just realized but... why are we bothering with Android Studio. correct me if im wrong but... we need *Unity* 
to actually create + add graphics on the tango right... unless Android has some Canvas thing like HTML does :/ 
sorry im not super experienced
