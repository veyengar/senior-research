I have no clue how to find the Tango files. There is almost nothing online. Wonderful. 
Also, I didn't see any of the changes mentioned in your previous commit statement on the other repo. So yeah,
not sure if you pushed anything or if something went wrong on my end.

Inside of hello_area_description, there is a file called AdfUuidListViewActivity.java. Within that file, 
There is a method alled private void exportAdf(String uuid) on line 220. This method appears to export the ADF.
Maybe if we change the location it exports to, we can get the files? 

Cleaned up our main files a bit, idk. Didn't know what the hell else to do. Hopefully we get stuff done in 8th
today. 

This link is ok: https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/unity/reference/class/tango/area-description#savecurrent
If you scroll down, you'll find a method called ExportToFile. This is the method we wanna use I think. To get 
the adf file.
