yO:

Just a reminder to finish your Periodic Progress Check because it will be due at the end of your period!
(if you didn't finish it like me, you will still have time to work on it!!1!11!!!!1!!1!)

What I did today:
1) Finished Periodic Progress Check
2) Worked on Research Project Proposal:

	- You can read more about my project idea under "Problem/Purpose/Engineering Goals"
	  but TL;DR I want to implement an uploadable photo gallery AND at the very least have video working too.

	- Finished a lot of Background.
	  It's a lot of information about how the Tango actually works.
	  You can move the information in the paragraphs around too.

3) Pushed and pulled from Git.

For you:

1) You don't necessarily have to watch the videos that I linked to you last time- those should start being helpful
when we actually get into the REAL programming. But, right now, I would highly recommend taking a look @ the videos
that I posted inside of the Research Project Proposal. Those actually explain how the Tango works, so its some
pretty important background information.
