Hey rchrdchng:


You probably won't ever see this cuz you don't have class until TUESDAY OCT 4th (a date which shall
live in infamy btw) and by then there will be another one ahead of this since Monday is a RED day!!
Woo I get two mobile classes kinda back to back.

What I did today:

1) Looked at the project proposal. I like all the changes you made. Changed all instances of 'Artificial Reality'
to 'Augmented Reality' which is the proper term.
