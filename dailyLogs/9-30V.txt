Varun I.

Hey rchrdchng:


You probably won't ever see this cuz you don't have class until TUESDAY OCT 4th (a date which shall
live in infamy btw) and by then there will be another one ahead of this since Monday is a RED day!!
Woo I get two mobile classes kinda back to back.

What I did today:

1) Looked at the project proposal. I like all the changes you made. Changed all instances of 'Artificial Reality'
to 'Augmented Reality' which is the proper term. 
	
	- Rigorously edited your paper. FiTe Me LuQr
	- Don't take it too harshly tho I didn't actually change that much T.T
	- Correct me if I'm wrong but I think we should include current/previous research/projects that are related
	  to ours in the Background section right?

2) Began looking at the Sample Project. I created an Android Studio Project with the java_augmented_reality_example
like you suggested. Had some problems with FeelsBad Studio

	- Gradle Sync didn't work
	- Stopping Gradle Sync didn't work either...
	- Took like 5 years to build the project initially.
	- FeelsBadStudio feels bad as usual
	- When building the project, downloading gradle components took forever. I stopped it after like 4 minutes. 
	 As a result. I couldn't do anything in the project because Gradle is broken.
	- I suspect I will need to delete the project and rebuild it properly next class. I might try at home to get
	  get some stuff working so I can test on Monday. Have to do that AI lab too rip.

Things for you:

Good job pulling and pushing from github! Make sure you are doing things in the right order. My usual Git process is 
$ git status --> $ git add -A (that adds all, you can also do $ git add --all or git add "actualFileName.txt") --> 
$ git commit -m "insert your message here" --> $ git pull (just gets like your log at this point) --> $ git push.

Idk try working on the project ig. Im gonna work more on the proposal until I get FeelsBad Studio working.

Have a good weekend ;).
