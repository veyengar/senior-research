Hey richie,

Hope your asking went well ;)

Today I messed around with FeelsBad Studio for literally all of class. I learned how to 
delete projects in Studio as well. You just go to the actual file location and delete 
the files. Deleted entire Tango sample project. Rebuilding project still took forever. I think
something might be wrong with my Android Studio itself. I recloned the entire repo. Gave up on 
Augmented reality example. JK point cloud example doesnt work either! Idk what to do at this point
Tell me which computer you use during class and I'll use it too to try to avoid this stuff.

FeelsBad Studio Feels Bad.
