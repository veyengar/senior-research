Hello Richard. Spirit video filming was good

I'll take a look at the videos you sent in a bit. 

Today I am going to focus on doing my progress report.

You should lmk what you do tomorrow and we can go from there.

What I did today:

1. Pulled from Git, got Richard's logs
2. Worked on Progress Check. Not quite done. Will finish for homework

What you should to tomorrow:

1. Keep working on getting a solid idea of what you want to do, the idea was yours after all
2. Let me know what you do as usual
