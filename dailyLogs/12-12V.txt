Varun's Log

So I can't find an onDrawFrame() method so I'm not sure what to do about the screenshot.
Ask Mr. Kosek next class. 

For rendering, the project already imports openGL. Go to the AugmentedRealityRenderer.java
and look through it. That shows you how to render things. It's similar to Unity objects if
you have ever used that. But yeah if you look through some Rajawali things you can def. 
find how to make a plane and overlay an image. 

I think a good goal for this week would be to get an image overlayed on a plane and take a
screenshot of it. But we gotta focus.

lmk what happens tmrw.
