Richard's Log

i feel like Google's documentation for android studio is some ass but...

What I did today:
- we had 2 discussions back to back so that took up a good amount of time in class
- worked some more on the camera preview... literally this is impossible lololol
I uploaded my files to Github and I *kinda* know what I'm doing but Google's documentation is pretty unhelpful to anyone
who is just learning to use Android Studio

For you:
- play around with that globe example if u wanna
- design a logo
- help figure out what the hell is going on with my code lol
	- I'm stuck on the "Placing preview in a layout" portion. Not sure if I put the <activity> thing in the right place.
	- Also, there are some issues with the CameraActivity class. It needs to access CameraPreview, but it can't without being
	in the same file. But if it is in the same file, it needs to be a private class. But I think that if I change it to a
	private class, the program won't work.
	- Also, I can't figure out what "main" is in CameraActivity in the line setContentView(R.layout.main);
	- Also can't figure out how to fix  mCamera = getCameraInstance();
