Running-out-of-ideas-for-clever-titles log

yo yo yo bro

what I did today:
1) had a seminar about internet privacy... throwback to the Circle and bourjaily sama lololool
2) my normal school comp decided to die, so I had to switch to a new one...
	- needed to redownload Android Studio >.< WHAT AN L AHHHHH
	- in the event that you want to use a school computer that has Android Studio, check the computer right next
	to the one I usually use. I finally downloaded it by the end of class!!!!
3) finished up stuff for my own seminary. Kosek told me that you were going tmrw (10/26). best of luck! tell me about
