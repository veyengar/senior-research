Richard's Logarithm

im really tired today and my head is throbbing so I decided to work on my stuff for the seminar

Kosek seems to be under the impression that we are presenting about the same thing, but we aren't and i was too much
of an awkward teenager to break it to him :/

For you:
November is fast approaching, so i think we should start making some concrete ideas
if you could get a tablet from kosek and sketch a pretty simple interface, then we can both be on the same page l8r
also any ppanda fan art would be appreciated (y)

**oops had to modify your log to resolve git issues**
