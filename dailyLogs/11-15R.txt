Richard's feelsbad Log

What I did today:

- shared a new repo with you yesterday called testproject
lemme know if it works :/ feelsbad studio is pretty frustrating

- kept working on the live camera preview...
yea this is hard lol but I think I'll get it done by the end of November.

For you:

- lemme know if you can get the stuff in the testproject repo. if not, just talk to Mr. Kosek I guess
	- if u got it to work, im still having some of the same issues:
	  In CameraPreview.java, for some reason it doesn't know what main is and it doesn't know what getCameraInstance() is.
	  I thought that getCameraInstance was part of the Camera class but I guess not :(
	- also, ignore the fact that Camera is depreciated. I tried importing camera2, but it never worked and I read online that
	  using the depreciated Camera should be fine. Also, we only need the camera to give us the view so it shouldn't be a big deal.

- look into Rajawali. To use video, Rajawali utilizes the SurfaceTexture class. Right now, I am using SurfaceView just to get a camera
preview, but it should be easily changed later. At the very least, we can still keep the Camera class.
