name that tune in ur commit!

What I did today:
- I wouldn't call it feelsOKstudio, more like feelsEhstudio
	- Tried to make custom code so that if something was detected by depth perception, an audio file would play saying
	"Oh yes, daddy!" Couldn't get it to work though, might keep working on it next class.

- Spirit Challonged some people for the last half of class. We walked by the art room and I saw you and Alys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
smh freshman; snr Pou's freshman class literally just sat there while she was screaming her lungs out xD I rec. that you
spirit challonge some kiddos during SR also. Mr. Kosak is pretty chill about it as long as you guys don't take too long.

For you:
1) idk bro, just do whatever. since I'm playing around with depth perception, maybe come up with some small project that
exploits are learning or motion tracking? up to you.
