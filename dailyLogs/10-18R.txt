hope u had fun @ the cheer competition, and ayyyyyyy no school tomorrow!!

For you:
(starting off with a "For You" today instead of a "What I did" to make things a little spicy)

1) You mentioned using a beacon + the physical web in your log yesterday. I was originally thinking about doing something
similar, but the physical web can only be accessed through a browser (specifically, chrome but I think some other browsers
might work too). If we do things with the physical web, we probably can't use the rest of the features that Tango offers :/

Basically, eh. its a good idea, but we need to look into whether or not the Tango's features are compatible with beacon tech.

2) share your pics bb ;)

What I did today:

- grinding feelsEh Studio
	- took a step back and finished the "My First App" project from Google becuase I wanted to get more familiar with
	feelsEh Studio
	- experimenting with playing sound files and its being kinda glitch. if you have any projects from Mobile that used
	a mp3 file (like a dank meme soundboard), pls share that with me on github bc that would save a lot of debugging.
	If you don't tho, thats fine :P

- started preparing some articles for my seminar next Monday (so freelo, it takes like 5 min to prepare lolololol)
- fixed the formatting in the Abstract of the paper. I pushed the new document to github.
- got distracted and started playing with the Online Sequencer. still working out that Star Wars sequence doe teeheeXD
