High School Boys and Gallery Image Pickers

Varun found a new and improved link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5309190/android-pick-images-from-gallery

Varun implemented this code and now Richard can look at the photos on the device gallery
and pick one! IDK what it does after tho. So I haven't done that bit yet. You might want 
to ask Mr. Kosek a question along the lines of "how do I access that image using the 
PICK_IMAGE_REQUEST thing that points to the result of the startActivityForResult method.
I've commented pretty thiccc so u should get what I'm saying.

Varun didn't rlly touch screenshot (Sorry). p exciting stuff happening tho. Lets go ham 
for a while.

O HEe SaAmA wa MiiiTeru Yo! I love the ending song.
