Konichi wa fellow anime brothers and sisters, I am Demon Lord Wataru of the heavens. Right now you are at the gates
of my world, my world of anime. Words cannot describe it my bountiful paridise. In my realm, all that I have 
gather in my travels lie here. Relics of different wolrds that I have visted. Searching, searchig far and wide 
for these priceless artifactes. Searching the different realm and worlds, to find what I love the most, Anime. 
Nothing can satisfy me more then the colorful beauty of its bountyness. Here at this world, I have set down in 
stones, my relics of anime. From photo to momentos of my travel. Long live Anime!! Shout it out my fellow brother 
and sisters. Click on the picture to enter the realm of beauty. So strap yourself to the screen, and fight off all
those who would oppose you and parpare to go blind.
