What I did today:
Worked on the uploading images stuff today. I did the onActivity stuff and I think that part works, and I managed to get
the image URI and I'm trying to save it into the drawable folder (see comments). Afterwards, I need to go back to the renderer file and
add a method that can change the texture. grind xd

lines that i added today:
line 347 (start of onActivity)
line 170 in Renderer (start of method to change texture; don't look at the content here bc it is whack)

for you:
I think you should work on saving the URI to the drawable folder. After that, I can get it to work through the Renderer.
Otherwise, work on screenshot function (y)
ganbatte ne!
