4-19-17: The End is Near

Dear Richard,

The calendar on the moving board thing got me shook. We r pretty close to the end of our careers (not that they
ever really began). Kosek sensei has expressed his annoyance at the general apathy pervading the senior classes.
So lets get our sh*t together. Today was something of a circus, spent most of class fixing android studio/finding 
my computer. Its the one all the way on the end next to the phone cabinet and the door to the closet. Gross. But 
yeah, we definitely need to get the project working on some level.

Goals:
Restore image function (make the app not crash every time)
Make nice UI (rn its p @$$) 

yeah, try to put in like 45 min of werk per 90 min o class. 

ZA WORLDO.

lul. My Hero Academia is p good too. 

after ap weeks, we will be free at last. I'm gonna try to get a baito, you should too :^). Make dat $$
RN I'm applying to Chipotle and KFT.
