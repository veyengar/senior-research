So uh they released the title of the next Star Wars movie today. Star Wars Episode VII: The Last Jedi
currently freaking out over this.. So today in class I tried to confirm whether or not our thing got
saved to internal storage. Looks like it does! Was fiddling around with it for a majority of class so 
I didn't get a chance to work much on the upload part. I think you should ask Kosek sama for help during
the long period tmrw and grind it out if possible. We def need to move on.

Lucasfilm. Kinda came to me yesterday while I was rewatching the STar Wars Rebels season 2 finale for like
the 20th time. Decided I'm going to do whatever it takes to work there one day. 

Ya lol,
