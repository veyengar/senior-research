Hello Richard, Hope you had a good weekend!

We CANNOT save a file to res/Drawable. The APK is read-only at runtime. The plan according to koseku sensei is
to save to Internal Storage and get it from there. Internal storage is our APP's storage space on the user's 
device. This should be good I think. https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal

So I'm pretty sure I got it to save the URI in the internal storage. Now we need to figure out how to let the Renderer
know this. If the Renderer can be told to check something/somewhere to see if the user has chosen a piece they want to
display, it can be changed to get the image from internal storage.
