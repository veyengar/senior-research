hey varb:

i hope u r having a gr8 day so far

What I did today:
1) Edited Research Proposal (read for important changes, TL;DR at very end)
	- First thing I did is I removed my original paragraph and replaced it with the last paragraph of
	  your revised version. Now it starts, "The purpose of this project..."

	- You are probably wondering: "but richo, what happened to my other stuff?!?!?"
	  Your other paragraphs have been moved to the end of the "Background" section. Specifically, they are the
	  last 2 paragraphs. There is a connecting paragraph immediately before it to make the transition smoother.
	  My rationale for moving your paragraphs is because I really wanted to keep them, but the "Purpose" section
	  has a cap of 5 sentences. They seem to fit well into the "Background" section but lemme know if you disagree.

	- TL;DR replaced my old paragraph with your third paragraph, moved your first two paragraphs to the end
	  of "Background"

2) Setting up feelsbad Studio

3) I downloaded Tango AR Pets AND tangominoes! If you still need to download/troubleshoot some stuff for Android Studio like me, 
you can play while you wait!!!

For you:

Do what you've been doing. Try to finish a Tango sample project. Maybe try the java_augmented_reality_example?
