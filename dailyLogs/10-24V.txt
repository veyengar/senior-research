So I forgot about my presentation today. Oops. I'm going on Wednesday now!
(links at the top are for me).
I worked on finding articles for my presentation most of today. I downloaded
the pen tablet drivers onto my account/machine so I can use it on Wednesday. 

On wednesday, I'm going to draw things. You have one week left until November. 
I'm going to try to draw the basic interface as well as what I want it to look like. 
You can provide feedback/your own sketches/thoughts.
