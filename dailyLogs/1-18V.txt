Ok so I figured out today that there is a hole bunch of stuff that we downloaded in the example that is like completely useless. It will also break our code if we do certain things.
Cleaned up a bit of it. Spent a long time on that. Didn't know why code was just breaking until it told me.

It seems that the SaveToInternalStorageMethod doesnt work. More specifically, I put a toast in there but its never toasting. Try to see if you can fix that.Maybe you can try puttin the 
user image in a simple image view just to make sure we got it. That would b a good intermediate step. Maybe try that.

Kosek sama is getting kinda sus at our lack of progress. We gotta get going. Also, if you are looking for something to watch, I'd suggest Star Wars: The Clone Wars or Star Wars Rebels.
both of those shows r p good. At least I liked em a lot.

A simple act of generosity can fill a galaxy with hope.
