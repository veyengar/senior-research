Ok so I figured out today that there is a hole bunch of stuff that we downloaded in the example that is like completely useless.
Cleaned up a bit of it. Spent a long time on that. 

It seems that the SaveToInternalStorageMethod doesnt work. More specifically, I put a toast in there but its never toasting. Try to see if you can fix that.

Kosek sama is getting kinda sus at our lack of progress. We gotta get going.
