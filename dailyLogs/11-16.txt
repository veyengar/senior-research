ANDROID STUDIO FINALLY WORKED!

ok so I'm past the bs setup phase. Downloaded some tango examples from google.
Made a new public folder on the C: drive of YOUR COMPUTER so we don't have to screw
around as much anymore. We should still push to Github tho for safety. I just decided
to work on your computer from now on. Save stuff in that folder if you can. Its called
"work". 

Bro theres a sample called tango video overlay sample..check it out lol.
