Hey Richard

Something amazing happened today, FeelsBadStudio evolved into FeelsOkStudio!
I finally got the Gradle working on ur machine. The problem was that I was saving my 
projects on my M: drive instead of the C: drive! I ran a bunch of the examples. Here 
are the results:

- Video example shows that the tango's video input with tracking is not as hi res as 
  normal video

- Area perception example shows that tango gets decent coordinates for area, I'm not 
  super sure how this works >.< you should check it out.

- Depth perception cuts off at about 6 in to 1 foot. Anything closer registers as 0. 
  Might have implications for our project. 

I didn't spend much time on the writeup. Will take a look at that later.

Have a good weekend! Maybe we'll see eachother. I don't have Mobile for another week!
