Richard's Log

couldnt get much done feelsbad

go to work folder -> tango-examples-java -> java_basic_examples -> hello_area_description
that has some stuff about adf's but i cant get the gradle to work

here is the documentation on adfs:
https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/java/java-area-learning

ik it doesnt work, but i tried sticking the first piece of code:
try {
    mConfig.putString(TangoConfig.KEY_STRING_AREADESCRIPTION, uuid);
} catch (TangoErrorException e) {
    // handle exception
}

into the top of the activity and then later deleted it. :///

mr. kosek doesn't really know where to go from here either. he tried to help me actually find the adf files that we had saved on the tango.
couldnt find them even after doing all this cmd stuff, even though we can see them in the adf tool app. also, explorer app can't
locate them either, so literally no one knows where they went (tilTED).

h o n e s t ly, i have no idea what the next step is. i thought that area learning would be straight forward but there is like 0 documentation
on this.
