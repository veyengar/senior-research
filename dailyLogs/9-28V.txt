Hello Richard,

Thanks for the reminder, I checked this last night and finished my progress report at home 
thanks to you. 

Things I did today:
1) Turned in Periodic Progress Check

2) Worked on Research Project Proposal:
	
	- Rewrote some parts of what you had, I left yours aboved and highlighted my proposed 
	  changes, additions, etc. Lmk what you think about the changes
	
	- My purpose thing is way too long, keep what you think is important. 

3) Installing Android Studio. GG

4) Made a personal repo for testing. Idt we need to have the same test project right? I didn't 
   want to put my testing stuff into the shared repo in case your testing stuff conflicts. So I 
   made a new repository for my tango test project. I got it off of gitHub near the end of class.
   Havent done much yet though.
