So since today was a short day, I got us up and running on GitHub!! Theres a new repo called sr-project
and I've invited you as a collaborator. The comp we currently work on is kinda messed up (as you know)
and Kosek sama said when they came to fix it, it might mess up our stuff. So I moved it onto git. When 
you work on the project, make sure you commit it to GitHub. There are three classes I plan to keep 
working in during 2nd semester. BC, mobile, and AP Art. So we gotta keep going until we have something 
worth showing. Think of the next feature we need. I've brainstormed a few and included them below:

1) Location, this is big!
2) Making the images kinda mesh with the walls, kinda related to location.
3) Getting multiple images in there
4) 3D images/videos

Yeah, you should pick what to do next.

Ganbatte neh, please pray for my BC grade :'( Not tryna get rescinded here.
