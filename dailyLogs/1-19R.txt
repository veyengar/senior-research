T-1 days until President Trump!!!!!!!!!!

What I did today:

- added method on line 276 in renderer
  it's a shot in the dark but here is what im aiming for:
	1) activity calls the method loadimagefromstorage and passes in the path as an argument
	2) loadimagefromstorage then sets the texture for a new earth and adds that earth to the scene

^^to do the above, i made earthMaterial a private global variable at the top (line 70) and commented out an old line (line 108)

- started working on the progress report. shared with u on docs.

well, a double rainbow is a phenomenon of optics that displays a spectrum of light due to the sun shining on droplets of moisture in
the atmostphere; does that explain it?
