Made progress today!!!!!!!!!
So I figured out how to load the ADF. Here is a good link: https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/java/reference/TangoAreaDescriptionMetaData#KEY_TRANSFORMATION
That is the data in the ADF file, the one we want to use is the Transformation data. Look into that.



Hope u had a good weekend.
