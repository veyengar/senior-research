wOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO nice dancing buddy, lovin' that footwork doe ;)
also first post in October!!! 1/10 months completed (jk 1/5 months completed bc 2nd semester xd)

What I did today:

1) Literally spent all class charging the Tango. Taking L's.

2) Finished the "Abstract"; feel free to edit. Didn't feel like writing the introduction to the "Background" so you can do it <3

3) Added a title. It's a work in progress :/

For you:

- Last class you asked about which computer I used. When you go into the classroom, walk to the second
row of computers. My computer is the first one of the left. Look for "MINE" @ diagram below:

do much today bc the Tango was completely out of power ;(
