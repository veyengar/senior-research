So this github thing became a mess today. I can't open your zip file properly
in Android Studio. I made a new repo just for the android studio project. Can 
you put your thing in there not as a zip file but just as a normal project? Then
I can import from version control on Android Studio and I think it'll work a lot
better. 

What I did today:

- Messed around with your zip file and AS for all of class. Made no progress.
- I think something is wrong with your zip file, I can't open it properly.
- Literally nothing else fml


For you:

- Figure out how to collaborate on the project more easily, if we stopped having 
  dumb issues like this we could make so much more progress..... :(
- Try to get the camera thing working, that'd be nice.
- If I can open the project and stuff I'll try to fix it up.

Have a good weekend
