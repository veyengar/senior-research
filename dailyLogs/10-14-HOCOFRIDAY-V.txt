Excellent Hawk mode. AYYYYY we watched the Spirit Vid in class.
Mr. Kosek said it was one of the best spirit vids!

Put the proposal in a Word Doc, formatted and sent it to him. 

Notes from Mr. Kosek's mini lesson.

Purpose should be like an upside down triangle. Biggest and most important thing at the top.
Gotta have the "what did you do" RIGHT AT THE FRONT. Our purpose purpose actually fits that.
Minimal details in the purpose. Just enough to understand the first sentence. Ours is fine.
We will see what he says. 

Background should list and describe/discuss the pieces of the technology stack (stack is
just a fancy word for "list of technologies I will be using for all aspects of the proj).
For example. Over the summer, I used MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB (database tool),
Express (tbh idk what this does), Angular.js(front end framework), Node.js (backend frame-
work). So a Stack has all the components. Along with this, the background should include 
current uses of the technology components in the real world or relevant theories relating to
their usage.

ALSO you were right abt the quote, its IP MAN! Hes apparently a legend in the new movie :). 
Excited to watch that with you kids.

HOCO HYPE. Also happy birthday to Alyssa!!

Hope you have/had a good weekend. :D
