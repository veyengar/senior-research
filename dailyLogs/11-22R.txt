Richard's log

I haven't pushed my logs to git in a while, so I decided to copypasta them into this one log.

What I did today:
- I copied the tango video example into my own M: drive. Worked a bit on the interface, but so far, nothing really does anything.

- The next step that I am trying to do is to use Rajawali to import a 3D object into the tango. I'm having some trouble tho-- I think it
has to do with the way that I organized my files :/ gonna try to work through it

- I moved a very very basic version of the app into the C: drive. My task for you is to try to program the view button so that
when you press it, everything else disappears and the live feed from the camera takes up the entire screen. 
	

*feel free to change any of the existing code, since it is just there to help visualize what the interface might look like. 
change it to actually work if you find that it is interfering with your plans*
